The Pharmaceutical Shop Database project is 
a structured database system designed to 
efficiently manage the operations of a 
pharmaceutical retail shop. It includes a well-defined schema that organizes data related to medicines, suppliers, customers, 
and transactions. The database ensures smooth
inventory management, tracks sales, and 
maintains customer records while 
allowing easy data retrieval through 
SQL queries.

This project serves as a foundation for businesses looking to digitize their pharmaceutical operations, enabling streamlined stock management, sales tracking, and customer interaction. The provided SQL scripts allow for easy database setup, data insertion, and execution of common queries to retrieve essential business insights.
